## Overview

Dogma is a comprehensive suite of tools for building robust message-driven
applications in Go.

It provides an abstraction for describing your application's business logic with
strict separation from the "engine" responsible for message delivery and
persistence.

## Features

- **[Event sourcing]** — Dogma records every state change as an immutable event.
  This enables comprehensive auditing and allows you to build or rebuild
  read-optimized views from the event history at any time.

- **Grounded in [Domain-Driven Design]** — Dogma adopts core concepts from DDD
  to guide how developers decompose application logic and how messages flow
  between components.

- **High-level testing** — Dogma's [testkit] module encourages behavior-driven
  testing by helping you make assertions about message flow rather than
  application state. It integrates seamlessly with Go's standard [testing]
  package.

- **Native introspection** — Dogma's static analysis tools visualize message
  flow and application structure, enabling discovery of domain events across
  large codebases and multi-application projects.

- **Domain and infrastructure separation** — Dogma's API enforces a clean
  separation between application logic and infrastructure concerns such as
  message delivery, persistence, and telemetry.

- **Type-agnostic** — Dogma lets you represent messages and application state
  using any Go types that implement the standard [`BinaryMarshaler`] and
  [`BinaryUnmarshaler`] interfaces.

- **Flexible persistence** — Dogma supports a range of storage options including
  PostgreSQL and Amazon DynamoDB, enabling use across diverse environments.

## Ecosystem

Dogma is a collection of Go modules that together provide the tools needed to
build, test, analyze, and run message-driven applications.

- [dogma] — Defines the API for building applications.
- [testkit] — Utilities for testing Dogma applications.
- [projectionkit] — Utilities for building [projections] in popular database systems.

### Engines

An important Dogma concept is that of the [engine] — a Go module embedded within
your application binary that orchestrates message delivery, state persistence,
and the execution of application logic.

- [verity] — The original Dogma engine, designed for typical application loads
  in smaller deployments. While production-ready, it doesn't support scaling of
  a single application across multiple machines.

- [veracity] — The next-generation Dogma engine built for
  horizontal scalability and distributed workloads. The Dogma maintainers intend
  for Veracity to fully replace Verity, becoming _the_ production Dogma engine.

- [testkit] — A set of tools for testing Dogma applications. It includes an
  in-memory engine that allows inspection of application behavior without
  persisting state.

## Why _Dogma_?

The name is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the project's strong opinions about how
best to structure message-driven applications. It's not about rigid
rule-following, but about embracing consistent patterns that enable rich tooling
and clarity in complex systems — without sacrificing flexibility where it
matters.

## Getting started

If you're new to Dogma, we recommend starting with the [concepts] document to
gain a solid understanding of the core ideas and terminology used throughout the
ecosystem.

You can also explore the [example] application for a practical, working
implementation that demonstrates key concepts in action.
