// ProjectionMessageHandler is an interface implemented by the application and
// used by the engine to build a "projection" (also known as a "read model", or
// "query model") from events that occur within the application.
//
// Projection message handlers consume event messages, and do not produce
// messages of any kind.
//
// A version-based optimistic concurrency control (OCC) protocol is used to
// ensure that each event is applied to the projection exactly once.
//
// For each event the engine must supply the current version of an "OCC
// resource" which is compared against a version for that resource that is
// persisted within the projection. If the supplied version and the persisted
// versions match then the event is applied to the projection state, otherwise
// the event is rejected.
//
// Both resources and versions are engine-defined binary values that are not
// meaningful to the handler. They are represented as byte-slices. Empty and
// nil slices are valid and equivalent.

	//
	// If c matches the current version of r persisted within the projection
	// then the implementation MUST apply the event to the projection state and
	// update the persisted version for r to n. ok is true, indicating that the
	// event was applied.
	//
	// If c does not match the current version of r the implementation MUST NOT
	// update the projection state or the persisted version. ok is false,
