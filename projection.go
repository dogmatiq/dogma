// A ProjectionMessageHandler builds a denormalized view of the application's
// state that's optimized for querying.
//
// It handles [Event] messages to build and update projections - partial
// representations of application state tailored to specific use cases. For
// example, a projection might contain a list of customers with active shopping
// carts.
//
// Each event belongs to an ordered event stream, identified by a UUID. The
// engine delivers events in the order they appear on the stream, using a
// numeric offset to represent each event's position.
//
// A single projection may receive events from multiple streams, which may
// belong to different applications.
//
// To ensure exactly-once event processing, the handler must implement
// optimistic concurrency control (OCC) based on each event's position within an
// event stream. The [github.com/dogmatiq/projectionkit] module provides
// adapters for popular databases, like PostgreSQL and DynamoDB, that handle the
// OCC details.

	// the incoming event belongs, the event's offset within that stream, and
	// the checkpoint offset at which the engine expects the handler to resume
	// consuming from the stream.
	//
	// If the engine and handler agree on the checkpoint offset, the handler
	// must atomically apply the event and update its checkpoint offset to one
	// greater than the incoming event's offset. Otherwise, the handler must not
	// modify any data.
	//
	// In either case, the method returns cp, the new checkpoint offset for this
	// stream. If cp is one greater than the offset of the incoming event, the
	// engine considers the event handled successfully. Otherwise, an OCC
	// conflict has occurred, and the engine resumes delivering events starting
	// at cp.
	//
	// A non-nil error indicates that the handler encountered a runtime problem
	// other than an OCC conflict.

	// within a single scope in the order they occurred. It also preserves the
	// order of events from a single aggregate instance, even across scopes. It
	// doesn't guarantee the relative delivery order of events from different
	// handlers or aggregate instances.
